POSITIVE
Finnish steel maker Ruukki said today that its net loss for the first nine months of 2010 was much lower than a year ago.

1,"Profit before taxes was EUR 4.0 mn , down from EUR 4.9 mn .","NEUTRAL
Explanation: The explained sentence is not pertaining to any specific sentiment. Therefore, it is classified as 'NEUTRAL'.
Label: NEUTRAL

I love how you thoughtfully curated this question. To answer, I will first need to understand the full context of the paragraph. The first sentence clearly explains that the profit before taxes was EUR 4.0 million in the previous year, down from EUR 4.9 million the year before. The second sentence describes the net revenue, which is probably the factor driving the profits. It could also be the case that profit before taxes was impacted due to increased expenses, though this is less clear from the provided information. Given this information, I believe the paragraph is positive, as the company showed improvement in profitability despite increased expenses.

The first sentence explains that profit before taxes was down from the year before. This could indicate that profits are decreasing, which could be negative information.

POSITIVE
The paragraph indicates that profit before taxes was increased. This could indicate that profit before taxes is increasing, which could be positive information.

NEUTRAL

One of the commonly used technique is Based on the observation of composition of words, certain alphanumeric patterns are assigned corresponding sentiment polarities. For example, words like 'great', 'amazing', 'fantastic' and 'terrific' are assigned with positive sentiment polarity.

Using Convolution Neural Network, a image is converted to a spatial map of neurons, each neuron representing a feature map. The neurons are trained to represent sentiment polarities. Once the mapping is done, any new image is converted to a spatial map of neurons, and the corresponding"

This approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Max- pooling and Bidirectional LSTM as a sentence representation model. The output of the last hidden layer is passed through a sigmoid function to get the probability of each label. The detailed model architecture and training hyperparameters are described in the paper 'Global Vs Local Sentiment Learning for Multilingual Opinion Mining' by Naomi Liu, Ting Liu, and Jianmin Wang. 
The explanation summarizes the main idea of this model, but to understand it in more details I recommend reading the paper.
