Below a sentence is tokenized and each line contains a word token from the sentence. Identify 'Person', 'Location', and 'Organisation' from them and label them. If the entity is multi token use post-fix _B for the first label and _I for the remaining token labels for that particular entity. The start of the separate entity should always use _B post-fix for the label. If the token doesn't fit in any of those three categories or is not a named entity label it 'Other'. Do not combine words yourself. Use a colon to separate token and label. So the format should be token:label. \n\n"
